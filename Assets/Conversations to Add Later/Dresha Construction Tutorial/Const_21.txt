Oh dear, looks like we took a little too long building that battery. The Fuser is almost out of power.
You're gonna have to build the next batteries [color]880quickly[color] and [color]880carefully[color].
If you [color]880take too long[color] to build something, the Fuser will run out of power. But that's not all!
Every [color]880rotation[color] you make will also drain some of the Fuser's power.
[CHOOSE]
